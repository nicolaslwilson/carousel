# Weekend Challenge 01

This was the first weekend challenge we were given at Prime Digital Academy.

For this challenge the assignment was to build a carousel to display an array of Objects representing people in our cohort.

The carousel needed to have buttons to navigate through the array and should wrap around when the navigating past the end of the array.

Additionally, the carousel should display the current index being viewed and the total number of elements in the carousel.

Finally, the carousel should include a fade when transitioning between elements and advances automatically if no input has been given in the last 10 seconds.
